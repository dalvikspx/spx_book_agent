# SPX6900 Book Translation AI Agent

This AI agent can translate the book **"Discovering SPX6900: The World's First Pure Belief Asset E-book"** from English into all languages of the world.

## Original Book

The original book this translation is based on can be found here:
[SPX6900: Believing in the Future of Tokenized Cryptocurrency Investing](https://www.amazon.com/SPX6900-Believing-Tokenized-Cryptocurrency-Investing/dp/B0FC4BGVKJ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2YCS1OXUQBI4E&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.n6Yx7X9Yn1orvqzELSXuHODtAM-ahn-b_I1TIicOhNf3azDo_qbxUFGfvlYhqYaG._EaNwqxmSImYc7DfX6Gv2a08iuYhgKX1TbsVfIpeq1o&dib_tag=se&keywords=spx6900+book&qid=1757841026&sprefix=spx6900+b%2Caps%2C184&sr=8-1)

## Translation Capabilities

This AI agent can translate the entire book into any language worldwide, maintaining the original structure and meaning while adapting the content for different linguistic contexts.

## Author & Translation Quality

The author of this AI agent is Italian, which means translation quality can only be verified for Italian translations. Currently, the book has been translated into:

- **Italian** (verified by author)
- **Mandarin Chinese** (requires native speaker verification)
- **Hindi** (requires native speaker verification)

**We need native speakers to verify the quality of non-Italian translations.**

_All tips are greatly appreciated and help support further development!_

## Current Limitations

The AI agent has some known limitations that users should be aware of:

### 1. Literal Translations

Some words may be translated too literally, missing contextual meaning. For example:

- "tip" might be translated as "suggestion" instead of "gratuity/tip"
- Similar context-dependent terms may need manual review

### 2. Image Extraction Challenges

The AI agent attempts to identify and extract images from each page of the book, but since OpenAI models aren't specialized for precise image detection, accuracy can be limited.

**Manual Image Solution:**

- The AI agent is smart enough to detect if images already exist for a page in the `extracted_images` directory
- If images are found, it will use the existing images instead of attempting to crop new ones
- For better results, manually extract images by taking screenshots from the original PDF and placing them in the corresponding page directory within `extracted_images/`

### Directory Structure for Images

```
extracted_images/
├── page-001/
│   └── page-001-img-01.png
├── page-002/
│   ├── page-002-img-01.png
│   └── page-002-img-02.png
└── ...
```

## How to Use

1. Place the original PDF in the project directory
2. Run the translation agent
3. For optimal image quality, manually add extracted images to the appropriate page directories
4. The agent will generate the translated book with properly embedded images

## Contributing

Native speakers of various languages are welcome to contribute by:

- Reviewing translation quality
- Suggesting improvements for context-dependent translations
- Providing feedback on cultural adaptation of content
